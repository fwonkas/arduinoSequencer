Arduino Sequencer
=================

A basic arduino musical instrument. Inspired by [Arduino Punk Console](http://www.beavisaudio.com/projects/digital/arduinopunkconsole/).

Requirements
------------

  * [SPI VFD](https://github.com/adafruit/SPI_VFD) - you can use whatever display you want, of course. I'm using this [20x2 VFD](http://www.adafruit.com/products/347)
  * 16-step rotary encoder (oddly, the one I have doesn't use gray code)
  * 3 10k pots
  * 1 speaker or audio-out jack

How everything is hooked up can probably be guessed at from the code, but
I'll update this later with a good description.
